# Nepal Groundwater Monitoring Dashboard


## Background

The code of this repository is a product of the CSISA-Resilience project in partnership with Nepal’s Groundwater Resources Development Board and aims to contribute to Nepal’s capacity to operate a digital groundwater monitoring system through a small pilot project in the USAID Feed the Future Zone of Nepal’s Tarai region. The ongoing expansion of groundwater resources development will undoubtedly provide great contribution to Nepal’s irrigation sector and food security. Along this way, a digital groundwater monitoring system will be critical to help the country guide the development and management of the resource by providing decision-makers and communities with adequate spatial evidence and information about the opportunities and risks for sustainable and equitable groundwater use.

The Cereal Systems Initiative in South Asia (CSISA; www.csisa.org) is supported by USIAD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and implemented jointly with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). In Nepal, new support from USAID has led to the implementation of the CSISA Covid-19 Response and Resilience Activity (CSISA-Resilience), which is also implemented with Texas A&M University, Cornell University, and International Development Enterprises (iDE). CSISA-Resilience involves two inter-linked objectives that address CSISA’s strengths in core areas needed to assist in COVID-19 response and recovery, as
well as Nepal’s longer-term building of processes and structures that can enhance resilience to shocks, with emphasis empowering youth and overcoming challenges faced by women headed farm households.
