# This is the key configuration file for the docker compose setup.
# Each service represents a seperate docker container.
# Docker compose then starts all containers together and let's them communicate.
# Key services used are the Database, Webserver, Django App, HTTPS Certification, and cron job.
# For each service refer to the respective dockerfile for more information on how that service is build.
# In order to ensure that containers can use shared files, we are using volumes that are shared across containers.
# For more info check on https://docs.docker.com/compose/ for more information.
# The main elements of the app are stored in the web service / container, where the Django app lives.
# So refer to the ./Dockerfile for more information on the webApp app.
