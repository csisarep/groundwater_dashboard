            <p>
              This website is a product of the CSISA-Resilience project in partnership with Nepal’s Groundwater Resources Development Board and
              aims to contribute to Nepal’s capacity to build a digital groundwater monitoring system through a small pilot project in the USAID
              Feed the Future Zone of Nepal’s Tarai region. The ongoing expansion of groundwater resources development will undoubtedly provide
              great contribution to Nepal’s irrigation sector and food security. Along this way, a digital groundwater monitoring system will be
              critical to help the country guide the development and management of the resource by providing decision-makers and communities with
              adequate spatial evidence and information about the opportunities and risks for sustainable and equitable groundwater use.

              The Cereal Systems Initiative in South Asia (CSISA; www.csisa.org) is supported by USIAD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and is
              led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and implemented jointly with the International Water Management
              Institute (IWMI), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).
              In Nepal, new support from USAID has led to the implementation of the CSISA Covid-19 Response and Resilience Activity (CSISA-Resilience),
              which is also implemented with Texas A&M University, Cornell University, and International Development Enterprises (iDE). CSISA-Resilience
              involves two inter-linked objectives that address CSISA’s strengths in core areas needed to assist in COVID-19 response and recovery, as
              well as Nepal’s longer-term building of processes and structures that can enhance resilience to shocks, with emphasis empowering youth
              and overcoming challenges faced by women headed farm households. The views expressed on this website do not necessarily reflect the views
              of the donors.

              <ul>
                <li>This is the beta version of the dashboard and is designed to provide rapid access to the data that we are collecting and for soliciting rapid feedback about the data collection and visualization. We aim to upgrade this dashboard in the near future with a richer feature set.</li>
                <li> You are currently on the <a href="/home">home page</a>. Here we provide a brief overview of this project activity and instruction on how to use this dashboard. </li>
                <li> The <a href="/meta-data">Meta-data</a> Meta-data page provides more detailed background information and other relevant meta-data</li>
                <li> The <a href="/monitor">Digtial groundwater monitoring</a> page provides and overview of recently collected data through different monitoring methods (see below for more information). You can toggle the map to display different monitoring methods and click on the wells to see the data collected for each specific location and methods. </li>
                <li> The <a href="download">Download monitoring data</a> page provides access to the detailed data that has been collected and you can download it in CSV format. In the navigation bar you can also select the district and well type to show data for. </li>
                <li>The <a href="/historical">Histroical data</a> page contains data that has been collected by the GWRDB since the year 2000. Note that this data has not been cleaned, but it can be used to obtain a better feel for the groundwater level fluctuations that are typical in the region.</li>
